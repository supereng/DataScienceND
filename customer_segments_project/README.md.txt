Unsupervised Learning: Project Overview

In this project, I worked with real-life data provided to us by Udacity's Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. The data was related to a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. Their main question of interest was to identify facets of the population that were most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. My job was to use unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company.
